          <h2>The Fascinating Giraffe</h2>
          <p>
            Giraffes are one of the most iconic and recognizable mammals found across the savannas of Africa. With their extraordinarily long necks and distinctive spotted patterns, giraffes stand as the tallest living terrestrial animals in the world. These remarkable creatures can reach heights of up to 18 feet, with their necks alone measuring up to 6 feet in length. Despite having only seven neck vertebrae—the same number as humans—each vertebra is greatly elongated, allowing them to reach the highest branches of acacia trees for feeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evolution of the giraffe's long neck has been a subject of scientific debate for centuries. While many assume it evolved solely for reaching high foliage, recent research suggests multiple factors contributed to this unique adaptation. Competition for food resources, sexual selection where males use their necks in combat for mating rights, and the advantage of spotting predators from great distances all likely played important roles in shaping these magnificent animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa, from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Their range has diminished significantly due to habitat loss and human encroachment, making conservation efforts increasingly critical. Today, there are four distinct species of giraffe, each with unique genetic markers and geographic distributions that scientists continue to study.

          <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
          <p>
            Adult giraffes typically weigh between 1,750 and 2,800 pounds for females and 2,400 to 3,000 pounds for males. Their height can reach between 14 to 19 feet from hoof to horn tip. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern of irregular brown patches separated by lighter hair, much like human fingerprints. These patterns help with camouflage and temperature regulation in the African heat. Their long, prehensile tongues can extend up to 20 inches and are specially adapted for stripping leaves from thorny branches without injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cardiovascular system of a giraffe is equally remarkable, designed to pump blood up their long necks to their brains. Their hearts can weigh up to 25 pounds and generate blood pressure roughly twice that of humans. Specialized valves in their neck veins prevent blood from rushing to the head when they bend down to drink, and their blood vessels have extra elasticity to accommodate the pressure changes that occur with movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giraffes possess excellent eyesight, which combined with their height, allows them to see long distances across the savanna. Their large eyes, positioned on the sides of their heads, provide nearly 360-degree vision. They also have keen hearing and a good sense of smell. The horn-like protrusions on their heads, called ossicones, are different in males and females—males' ossicones are larger and bald on top due to frequent necking battles with other males.

          <h2>Diet and Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            Giraffes are herbivores that primarily feed on the leaves and twigs of acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees. They can consume up to 75 pounds of foliage daily, spending most of their waking hours browsing. Their height gives them a competitive advantage in reaching vegetation that other herbivores cannot access. Giraffes are social animals that live in loose, open herds with no strong bonds between members except between mothers and their calves. They are most active during the early morning and late afternoon, resting during the hottest parts of the day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communication among giraffes is more complex than once believed. While they were long thought to be mostly silent, researchers have discovered they produce infrasonic vocalizations below the range of human hearing, particularly at night. They also communicate through body language, using their tails, ears, and posture to convey information to other giraffes. During mating season, males engage in a behavior called necking, where they swing their necks and heads at each other to establish dominance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Female giraffes typically give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of about 15 months. Remarkably, calves are born by dropping about six feet to the ground, as their mothers give birth standing up. Within hours of birth, calves can stand and walk, an essential survival adaptation in predator-rich environments. Mothers are protective of their young, and calves may stay with their mothers for up to 18 months, learning essential survival skills during this time.
